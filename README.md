# IPO-Analysis
As 2019 will be full of great IPO's, 
I'm analyzing data of past IPO's in different sectors to see if 
I can find insights on what's the best timing to buy a share in general after it arrives on the market.

You will find the code I used to analyze where minimum and maximum prices happen after a stock gets its IPO.

In that way, we can have an idea of what's the best investing strategy when it comes to IPO's: 
Buying the stock right away when it arrives on the market, or waiting a certain period before buying it? 

If the right answer is the second, we also want to find out how long 
is that periodd to wait before making a profitable purchase

In addition, you'll find a section where I plot the average trend of our stocks after their IPO's. 
It's done by normalizing daily returns of stocks, averaging them day by day, and plotting the result. 

With that, we can see what general trend are stocks following after their IPO's. 
If there is no specific trend, we should find a somehow flat curve, or one that has a lot of ups & downs without drawing a trend
